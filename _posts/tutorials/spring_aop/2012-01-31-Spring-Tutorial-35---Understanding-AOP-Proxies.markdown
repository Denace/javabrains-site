In this video, we go where no Spring AOP tutorial has gone before! We'll understand how Spring AOP works and how it uses proxy classes to apply advice.

The way Spring AOP works is much more complicated, but this simple implementation should give us a solid understanding of proxy objects and clarify the core concepts.
