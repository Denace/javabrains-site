In this tutorial, we'll learn about and write our own BeanFactoryPostProcessor. We'll also try out a handy BeanFactoryPostProcessor that comes with Spring: the PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer.

Note: As of Spring 3.1, it is recommended to use PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer instead as mentioned in the Java Docs: http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.1.4.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer.html.  *Thanks Fredrik!*
