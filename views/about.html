This is a non-commercial website; it is not intended to, and it does not, make money. This means two things: Firstly, all tutorials are free. Secondly, there are <em>no ads</em>. You'll see no ads on the site. And no ads on Youtube videos. I hope you'll appreciate the better user experience that results from it!</p> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12"> <p class="nav-header">Technologies used</p> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-12"> <p>This site is built using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and <a href="http://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>.
